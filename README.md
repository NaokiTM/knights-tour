# Knights tour solver

A pygame and python app that solves and allows the user* to solve the knights tour puzzle. Also my first ever python project!

The solving algorithm uses warnsdorff's rule to identify the move which has the least possible moves from it, and moves the knight there. 

The user* can also choose to solve the puzzle without any aid, and when this mode is selected any previous moves will be highlighted and the number of possible moves from any of the squares accessible is drawn out onto the chessboard. 

*(yet to be implemented)
